## 📜 Experience

I did an internship at MPPR in Londrina, Paraná. In addition to secretarial services, I created web automation or spreadsheet programs to help with work. I made automations in javascript and python. I used the Asana API and libraries like pandas and selenium.

I did projects during the IT course that helped me develop logic and search for knowledge.

I've done it and worked on some projects ranging from something simple such as a Cesar cipher, websites and automations, to KNN algorithms and simulators.

Currently, by doing the data science and IA course, I am conducting and learning techniques to work with large volumes of data and also understanding concepts and algorithms used in AI. I usually use the Python language to do the work, along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, among others.
